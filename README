amogus

building and running
====================

to build this shit, you will need:
* nasm assembler
* make (optionally you can assemble this shit manually)
* cat

write:
	$ make

and you will get your final, bootable disk image which you can
boot! to do this, find any medium which can be detected by BIOS
as bootable (USB pendrive). You can write:
	# dd if=amogus of=/dev/sdX status=progress
(/dev/sdX is your drive).
